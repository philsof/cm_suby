   <p>We live in a two story colonial that was built in the 1980’s.  We have 2 ½ baths in our home and they needed work to be done on them.  In fact, two of the full bathrooms needed major work/renovation.  We visited a showroom in North Plainfield and picked out faucets and fixtures, cabinets, counters, and tubs.  I had trepidation in regards to who I could trust to do the renovations; especially on multiple rooms and where would I start?  The firm that we purchased these fixtures also highly recommended Morgan’s firm and put their trust in him.  I contacted Morgan and he visited our home and made some recommendations, etc.</p>
  <p>We started on the first floor half bath and the end result was stunning.  Morgan was meticulous and he treated my home as his own.  He made sure that the end result was PERFECT and if there were imperfections with anything, he fixed them.  So, we had a party for family and the bathroom was completed on time and everyone spoke very highly of the professional work that was done.  Since this bathroom was perfect, I was ready for the second bathroom renovation to start.</p>
  <p>This bathroom was what the kids used while growing up and had chips on the sink area as well as the drain was rusting out and the bathtub needed major work.  The room was gutted and new tile (floor and walls), new sinks, new soaking tub, and glass doors (instead of a shower curtain) were installed.  What a transformation.  I loved the work that Morgan did.  He even painted the rooms as well.  Two down, one more to go!  I was expecting to start the third bathroom renovation in February/March 2015, however, an opening was available and Morgan started the Master Bath project during the coldest days of the winter.</p>
  <p> The entire room was gutted to the studs and ceiling.  Two walls were removed and a new door was planned.  The old shower stall, the linen closet, the old bathtub and ugly sinks were removed.  Morgan saved his best work for the Master Bath and transformed it to a beautiful and restful location.  I am so impressed with the transformation and the beauty of the room.  I relied on Morgan’s expertise and experience and he didn’t disappoint me.</p>
  <p>I am planning on a Kitchen remodeling project in the future and I’ll most definitely contact Morgan for his assistance.  Morgan is an excellent worker and he ensures that everything is perfect.  I would highly recommend him for any renovation project that is needed in your home.</p>

     <p>I have been using Mr. Suby for renovations for about 10 years and have been extremely pleased with all of his projects. These projects have included renovating bathrooms and kitchens, creating a bathroom from scratch, painting and lighting design/installation in several rooms, and finishing a basement. The overarching theme when working with Mr. Suby is quality and it is evident in all aspects of his work.</p>
     <p>Besides a quality finished product, the overall experience is also of high quality. The workers are punctual and polite. The estimates as far as when work will be started and completed have been accurate in my experience except in instances of a permit taking longer than expected to attain (not his fault).</p>
     <p>His pricing estimates are generally accurate as well assuming your specifications for the project does not change along the way. This was a big plus for me initially after having a bad experience with a contractor who charged me a lot more than originally quoted for a project whose scope did not change along the way. CM Suby has consistently delivered top quality work in all of the projects I have hired them for and I will continue to use them for all of my home projects and renovations.</p>

   <p>Morgan and team recently remodeled our kitchen and master bath. The pictures speak for themselves, but the end result is one we proudly show off to family and friends.  We were so impressed with the team's quality of work that we hired C.M. Suby to do a number of additional projects in our home. Morgan is fair, reliable and trustworthy. The workers were always punctual and polite and we became very comfortable having them in our home. We were particularly impressed with their craftsmanship and attention to detail; it was comforting knowing that they wouldn't cut corners and that we could trust the tasteful aesthetic and perfectionist quality of their work. We will be using Morgan again for future projects and recommend him without reservation.</p>

   <p>Morgan Suby recently renovated our master bath. He and his crew were meticulous with every detail. The crew kept the area incredibly clean and the work went off without a hitch. We highly recommend him and will look to him for any future renovations. His level of professionalism and understanding of products was second to none.

   <p>It was an absolute pleasure working with Morgan and his team.  From start to end they were professional, friendly and on time.  They took our tired looking 20 year old master bathroom and turned it into a custom spa like retreat for me and my wife.  We couldn’t be happier and I would highly recommend Morgan to anyone looking for a detail oriented professional who does what he says he will.</p>

     <p>I have used C.M.Suby ("Morgan") for two separate bathroom renovation projects and have been very pleased with both the experience and the results for a number of reasons.  First and foremost, I was extremely impressed with Morgan's concern for quality and his attention to detail.  One of the reasons that my bathrooms turned out so well is that everything was carefully and properly installed.  Others have commented favorably to me on the appearance of my bathrooms and want to know who did such nice work. </p>
     <p>I was also impressed by the courtesy, respect, and professionalism that Morgan and his crew exhibited.  Morgan always returned phone calls, showed up on time, etc.   I appreciate the fact that the work on my projects was essentially completed on consecutive days.  I would happily trust Morgan again with another renovation project!</p>
