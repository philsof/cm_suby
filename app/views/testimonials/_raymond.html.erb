    <p>I have been using Mr. Suby for renovations for about 10 years and have been extremely pleased with all of his projects. These projects have included renovating bathrooms and kitchens, creating a bathroom from scratch, painting and lighting design/installation in several rooms, and finishing a basement. The overarching theme when working with Mr. Suby is quality and it is evident in all aspects of his work.</p>
     <p>Besides a quality finished product, the overall experience is also of high quality. The workers are punctual and polite. The estimates as far as when work will be started and completed have been accurate in my experience except in instances of a permit taking longer than expected to attain (not his fault).</p>
     <p>His pricing estimates are generally accurate as well assuming your specifications for the project does not change along the way. This was a big plus for me initially after having a bad experience with a contractor who charged me a lot more than originally quoted for a project whose scope did not change along the way. CM Suby has consistently delivered top quality work in all of the projects I have hired them for and I will continue to use them for all of my home projects and renovations.</p>
