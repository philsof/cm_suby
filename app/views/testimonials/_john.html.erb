   <p>Morgan and team recently remodeled our kitchen and master bath. The pictures speak for themselves, but the end result is one we proudly show off to family and friends.  We were so impressed with the team's quality of work that we hired C.M. Suby to do a number of additional projects in our home. Morgan is fair, reliable and trustworthy. The workers were always punctual and polite and we became very comfortable having them in our home. We were particularly impressed with their craftsmanship and attention to detail; it was comforting knowing that they wouldn't cut corners and that we could trust the tasteful aesthetic and perfectionist quality of their work. We will be using Morgan again for future projects and recommend him without reservation.</p>
