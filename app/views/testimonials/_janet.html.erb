<p>We live in a two story colonial that was built in the 1980’s.  We have 2 ½ baths in our home and they needed work to be done on them.  In fact, two of the full bathrooms needed major work/renovation.  We visited a showroom in North Plainfield and picked out faucets and fixtures, cabinets, counters, and tubs.  I had trepidation in regards to who I could trust to do the renovations; especially on multiple rooms and where would I start?  The firm that we purchased these fixtures also highly recommended Morgan’s firm and put their trust in him.  I contacted Morgan and he visited our home and made some recommendations, etc.</p>
  <p>We started on the first floor half bath and the end result was stunning.  Morgan was meticulous and he treated my home as his own.  He made sure that the end result was PERFECT and if there were imperfections with anything, he fixed them.  So, we had a party for family and the bathroom was completed on time and everyone spoke very highly of the professional work that was done.  Since this bathroom was perfect, I was ready for the second bathroom renovation to start.</p>
  <p>This bathroom was what the kids used while growing up and had chips on the sink area as well as the drain was rusting out and the bathtub needed major work.  The room was gutted and new tile (floor and walls), new sinks, new soaking tub, and glass doors (instead of a shower curtain) were installed.  What a transformation.  I loved the work that Morgan did.  He even painted the rooms as well.  Two down, one more to go!  I was expecting to start the third bathroom renovation in February/March 2015, however, an opening was available and Morgan started the Master Bath project during the coldest days of the winter.</p>
  <p> The entire room was gutted to the studs and ceiling.  Two walls were removed and a new door was planned.  The old shower stall, the linen closet, the old bathtub and ugly sinks were removed.  Morgan saved his best work for the Master Bath and transformed it to a beautiful and restful location.  I am so impressed with the transformation and the beauty of the room.  I relied on Morgan’s expertise and experience and he didn’t disappoint me.</p>
  <p>I am planning on a Kitchen remodeling project in the future and I’ll most definitely contact Morgan for his assistance.  Morgan is an excellent worker and he ensures that everything is perfect.  I would highly recommend him for any renovation project that is needed in your home.</p>
