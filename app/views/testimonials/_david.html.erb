     <p>I have used C.M.Suby ("Morgan") for two separate bathroom renovation projects and have been very pleased with both the experience and the results for a number of reasons.  First and foremost, I was extremely impressed with Morgan's concern for quality and his attention to detail.  One of the reasons that my bathrooms turned out so well is that everything was carefully and properly installed.  Others have commented favorably to me on the appearance of my bathrooms and want to know who did such nice work. </p>
     <p>I was also impressed by the courtesy, respect, and professionalism that Morgan and his crew exhibited.  Morgan always returned phone calls, showed up on time, etc.   I appreciate the fact that the work on my projects was essentially completed on consecutive days.  I would happily trust Morgan again with another renovation project!</p>
