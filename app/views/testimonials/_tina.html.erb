     <p>I decided to renovate my kitchen and all I knew I wanted to update it from 1999 to 2016. Morgan and I discussed my options (colors, layout, appliances) and the look I was looking for. He listened and made recommendations to help me put my ideas into this amazing kitchen. He has an extremely strong work ethic and high standards when it comes to the quality of his work. He’s meticulous with every detail. Losing use of my kitchen wasn’t easy with a toddler, but Morgan understood and made the renovation go as smoothly as possible to ensure we weren’t out of commission for too long. Morgan is an extremely creative, trustworthy and reliable contractor.</p>
